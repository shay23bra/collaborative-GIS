# Collaborative GIS Application

This application enables real-time collaboration on drawing and analyzing areas on a map. Users can draw, view, and calculate the area of polygons in real-time, switch between map layers, and view other usersâ€™ actions as they draw.

## Features
- Real-time polygon drawing on a map
- Satellite and regular map layer switching
- WebSocket-based updates for real-time collaboration
- Area calculation for polygons

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Golang with Gorilla WebSocket and PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Leaflet.js, HTML, JavaScript
- Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial data storage
- Docker for containerized setup
